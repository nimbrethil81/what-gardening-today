# Changelog

All notable changes to "What Gardening Today?" will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning follows a simplified semantic scheme:

- **MAJOR** (e.g. 1.0 → 2.0) — architectural phase transitions per SPEC.md §6 (e.g. backend migration, native rewrite).
- **MINOR** (e.g. 1.0 → 1.1) — user-facing features, UI changes, and bug fixes within the current phase.

## [1.1] — 2026-07-08

### Changed
- Redesigned the "My Garden" tab for a more cohesive, modern look. Section headings ("Add to My Garden" and "My Garden") now use a small green accent bar beside the title in place of the previous plain heading style. The inventory list is now wrapped in a single pale-green tinted container, with thin dividers separating category groups (Lawn, Beds, etc.) inside it, rather than each group floating separately on the page background.

## [1.0] — Baseline

Initial baseline capturing the completed Phases 1–3 as documented in SPEC.md §6.

### Core capabilities
- **Daily task recommendations.** Season-aware, cooldown-suppressed, weather-filtered gardening tasks matched to the user's inventory. Tasks are surfaced via the "Today's Tasks" tab and driven by hierarchical asset matching against `Master_Task_Matrix`.
- **Stateful task completion.** Checkboxes on task cards log completions to `Task_Log`. The processing engine calculates `Date_Completed + Frequency_Days` to hide completed tasks for their cooldown window.
- **Dynamic inventory management.** "My Garden" tab lets the user add items via category tiles + item pill selector + optional custom reference name, and remove items via a two-tap confirm/execute soft-delete flow.
- **Environmental integration.** Frontend HTML5 Geolocation for the weather widget. Backend OpenWeather proxy via Apps Script. Combined `get_all` route returns season-and-weather-filtered tasks with the inventory in a single call.
- **PWA delivery.** Installable via GitHub Pages with service worker + Web App Manifest for iOS/Android home-screen installation.

### Architecture
- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS on GitHub Pages, no framework.
- **API:** Google Apps Script Web App as the sole external endpoint (`doGet` / `doPost`), including a secure weather proxy.
- **Data:** Google Sheets as a relational store (`User_Profile`, `Item_Dictionary`, `Master_Task_Matrix`, `Task_Log`, `Reference_Lists`).

### Known limitations at baseline
See SPEC.md §5E for the full list. Summary: hardcoded backend weather location; inverted wind suppression logic; parallel data-fetch paths that drift on tab switch; UTC midnight date-stamping edge case; cache-first service worker; unbounded `Task_Log`; legacy two-digit asset ID suffix fallback.
